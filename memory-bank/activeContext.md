# Active Context

Date: 2025-09-01

Current Focus
- Stabilize navigation across slide boundaries and ensure UI color/contrast consistency (especially light mode).
- Standardize slide title colors per latest direction (green #1F9632 for slides 2–12).

Recent Changes
- Fixed crash on last/first slide transition: Corrected ConclusionSlide props in App.tsx to pass conclusion, takeaways, contact (previously passed points incorrectly).
- Improved light-mode contrast on IntroSlide: changed text classes to map to darker shades via index.html light overrides.
- Updated title color across slides 2–12 to #1F9632 (Intro, Content, Tables, Demographics, Charts, Suggestions, Conclusion).
- Verified dev server reloads without errors; preview opened successfully.

Next Steps (Proposed)
- Consider unifying all accent elements (buttons, borders, underlines) to green for a cohesive identity.
- Add defensive optional chaining where arrays may be undefined (e.g., takeaways?.map) for robustness.
- Minor polish: ensure underline/divider accents match title color when desired.

Decisions
- Keep title slide (slide 1) styling unchanged for now; apply green to slides 2–12 only.
