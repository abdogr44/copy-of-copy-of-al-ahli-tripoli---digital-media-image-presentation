Founder Preferences & Project Insights

- Slide Titles: Use forest green #1F9632 for titles on slides 2â€“12.
- Arabic RTL: Maintain RTL layout and Tajawal font across the app.
- Contrast: Favor darker text mappings in light mode for readability.
- Props Discipline: Ensure slide components receive props consistent with SlideContent; avoid map on undefined arrays.
- Theming: Persist theme in localStorage; always set data-theme on <html> before paint to avoid FOUC.
- Identity: Legacy jonquil #F3CB13 currently remains for controls unless explicitly changed.
